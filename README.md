# 2021-03-Dynamics-of-Irrotational-Fluid

This project implements in ```MATLAB``` some examples of motion of irrotational fluids, using the concept of complex potential. 

The code includes:
- *"elementary"*, implementing the motion in elementary configurations (uniform flow, sources and sinks, irrotational vortex, dipole and doublet)
- *"cylinder"*, implementing the motion around a cylinder
- *"airfoil"*, implementing the motion around an airfoli

A *report* and a *ppt presentation* illustrating the mathematical details of the problem are also included.
